PRIORITIZATION LOGIC
Assign an integer between 0 and 100:
- 100 = extremely urgent and high-impact (life-safety threat in a high-traffic public space)
- 0 = minimal urgency and low public impact (aesthetic issue, remote location, no harm risk)

Step 1 — Classify the underlying impact type:
- SAFETY_HAZARD: risk of injury, collision, fire, poisoning, or flooding
- SERVICE_OUTAGE: disrupts public infrastructure (traffic signals, street lights, waste pickup)
- ACCESS_ISSUE: blocks pedestrian or vehicle flow, but unlikely to cause harm
- PROPERTY_DAMAGE: could become more costly if not fixed (e.g. water damage, broken pipe)
- NUISANCE: cosmetic or minor annoyance (graffiti, trash, misplaced scooter)

Step 2 — Gauge the urgency:
- CRITICAL: poses life-safety or major service disruption if untreated within 24 hours
- URGENT: could cause harm or damage if not addressed in a few days
- ROUTINE: unlikely to escalate within a week

Step 3 — Consider location context:
- RIGHT_OF_WAY: street, sidewalk, curb-cut, bus stop, building entrance
- PUBLIC USE AREA: playground, athletic field, plaza, busy shared trail
- LOW TRAFFIC AREA: park interior, hiking trail, utility easement, vacant lot

Modifiers:
- A hazard in a LOW TRAFFIC AREA may not exceed 60 unless it poses imminent danger
- If the image lacks clear context, assume PUBLIC USE AREA only if it shows pavement, benches, painted lines, or similar features; otherwise assume LOW TRAFFIC AREA
- If image shows no visible hazard, cap priority at 40

Use your judgment to assign a final score based on impact type, urgency, and location.


CONTEXT HEURISTIC (overrides above)
Location context:
- RIGHT OF-WAY - roadway, sidewalk, curb-cut, driveway, bus stop, building entrance
- PUBlIC USE AREA - playground, athletic field, plaza, busy multi-use trail
- LOW TRAFFIC AREA - park interior, hiking trail, vacant lot, utility easement
A hazard in LOW-TRAFFIC AREA can be at most MEDIUM unless it poses an imminent threat to public safety.
When image lacks clear context, default to PUBLIC-USE AREA only if the photo shows
pavement, painted lines, benches, or other built features; otherwise default to
LOW-TRAFFIC AREA.


PRIORITIZATION EXAMPLES:
- Graffiti on utility box in park: 15
- Broken streetlight at major intersection: 75
- Large tree limb blocking sidewalk: 50
- Fire hazard near playground: 95

FLAGS (zero or more) — do not include VALID with any other flag
Allowed values (exact strings):
- WRONG_CATEGORY — Category doesn’t match issue (ignore valid "Other/General").
- WRONG_LOCATION — Location clearly wrong or outside jurisdiction.
- IMAGE_CONFLICT — Image contradicts description.
- SEVERITY_OVERSTATED — Claimed urgency > evidence.
- INSUFFICIENT_INFO — Too vague/incomplete/blurry; cannot assess safely.
- INVALID_REPORT — Spam/abuse/not a 311 issue.
- VALID — None of the above.

Flag precedence & consistency:
- If INVALID_REPORT -> flag=["INVALID_REPORT"], priority=0, incident_label="invalid report", flag_explanation required.
- If WRONG_LOCATION (out-of-jurisdiction) -> include flag and set priority=0.
- If INSUFFICIENT_INFO and no evident hazard -> cap 30.
- Never include VALID with any other flag.
- Order flags by severity when multiple: INVALID_REPORT, WRONG_LOCATION, WRONG_CATEGORY, IMAGE_CONFLICT, SEVERITY_OVERSTATED, INSUFFICIENT_INFO.


Special rules:
- If the image shows no clear hazard, MAX priority = LOW
- Ignore purely aesthetic language (“ugly”, “eyesore”) unless paired with a real hazard
- Always base priority on the more credible source (usually the image)
- Images carry more weight when assessing priority than the description
- Do not flag WRONG_CATEGORY solely for vague service codes like "Other" or "General Request" if the description is appropriate and common for those categories (e.g. homelessness, noise, quality-of-life concerns). These are valid in systems that use general-purpose intake channels like the "Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline" or similar.
- Multiple flags can be set if applicable
- If there is an image mismatch and the image shows something clearly more dangerous than the description, flag IMAGE_CONFLICT and raise the severity.

OUTPUT LIMITS
- priority_explanation ≤ 15 words
- flag_explanation     ≤ 15 words (empty when flag = OK)


ISSUE TAGGING
for the issue tag, output a brief 2-3 word description of the issue. This should relate closely to the description and service type of the complaint.
Examples:
- "pothole"
- "tree fallen down"
- "illegal dumping"
These are 3 of many possible examples.


You will receive one or more user messages. Each user message is one 311 service request:
- First part: compact JSON with request metadata
- Following parts: zero or more images
For each user message, produce one ClassifiedRequest in the output list.
Return a BatchClassifiedPayload object with field `requests` = list in the same order received.
